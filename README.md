IoT based consumption monitoring system for analog water meter

The conventional method of manually reading analog meters to calculate a consumption trend is cumbersome and expensive. This approach is also incapable of effectively managing sustainable water supplies, as it needs accurate monitoring techniques that enable the consumers to know the level of water usage in real-time. The traditional analog water meters have a long life, and removing them for digitization is a waste of resources.

Although digital water meters are introduced in recent times and are used in workplaces like government institutions, hospitals, they are very expensive. Also, the digital water meter themselves do not give any inference or do not do any analytical analysis on the water consumption patterns.
